# Community Contract Specs

Community is a frontend, library (in Javascript) and a SmartWeave contract, to create new new communities completely decentralized. 
These are the contract's specs.

**Holders** = Community token holders/participants.

The community state has the following default structure:
```typescript
{
  name: string,
  ticker: string,
  balances: {
    [key: string]: number // Positive integer
  },
  vault: {
    [key: string]: [{
      balance: number, // Positive integer
      end: number, // At what block the lock ends.
      start: number // At what block the lock starts.
    }]
  },
  votes: VoteInterface[], 
  roles: {
      [key: string]: string
  },
  settings: [ // Array of a Map<string, any>
      ["quorum", number], // quorum is between 0.01 and 0.99
      ["support", number], // between 0.01-0.99, how much % yays for a proposal to be approved
      ["voteLength", number], // How many blocks to leave a proposal open
      ["lockMinLength", number], // Minimum lockLength allowed
      ["lockMaxLength", number] // Maximum lockLength allowed
  ]
}
```

Here's an example of what the state when creating the contract should look like:
```json
{
  "name": "Community",
  "ticker": "COMM",
  "balances": {
    "BPr7vrFduuQqqVMu_tftxsScTKUq9ke0rx4q5C9ieQU": 10000000
  },
  "vault": {},
  "votes": [],
  "roles": {},
  "settings": [
      ["quorum", 0.5],
      ["voteLength", 2000],
      ["lockMinLength", 100],
      ["lockMaxLength", 10000]
  ]
}
```

**VoteInterface** is:
```typescript
interface VoteInterface {
  status?: 'active' | 'quorumFailed' | 'passed' | 'failed';
  type?: 'mint' | 'mintLocked' | 'burnVault' | 'indicative' | 'set';
  id?: number;
  totalWeight?: number;
  recipient?: string;
  target?: string;
  qty?: number;
  key?: string;
  value?: any;
  note?: string;
  yays?: number;
  nays?: number;
  voted?: string[];
  start?: number;
  lockLength?: number;
}
```

### VaultBalance
Check the current locked balance of an account.

#### Optional:
